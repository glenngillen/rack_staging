# Rack::Staging

Don't let users accidentally stumble upon your staging servers, make sure
they're password protected.

## Usage

Include the `Rack::Staging` middleware into your `config.ru` like so:

    use Rack::Staging
    run MyApp.new

By default `Rack::Staging` will assume it's in a staging environment if the
hostname for the request contains the string "staging", or if an environment
variable of "STAGING" is set.

Username and password for authentication should be set to "STAGING_USER" and
"STAGING_PASS" environment variables respectively.

Alternatively `Rack::Staging` accepts a `Proc` as a parameter which will be
evaluated to determine whether an app is in your staging environment or not.
Use this method to override the default behaviour:

    use Rack::Staging, Proc.new{|env| env["HTTP_HOST"] == "foobar.example.org" }
    run MyApp.new

## Why would I want to use this?

Because it's easy to forget to make your staging server just *slightly*
different from your production box by restricting access to it. Hopefully
remembering to include this in your `Gemfile` is easier (I'll soon make it
insert itself automatically into the middleware stack for Rails >= 3.x.x apps).
